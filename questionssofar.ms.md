Key System Interactions:<meta_cognitive_summary>
The data flow through these components follows this pattern:

X2 (PC/Adder) determines next instruction address
X1 (Instruction Memory) provides instruction
X5 (MUX) routes data based on instruction
X3 (Register File) provides/stores operands
X6 (Data Memory) handles longer-term storage

Would you like me to:

Explain any specific component in more detail?
Break down the interaction between specific components?
Describe how a particular instruction flows through these components?
Elaborate on the timing relationships between components?
</meta_cognitive_summary>

This interview-style breakdown helps understand each component's role in the larger system. Each part has its specific function but works in concert with others to execute instructions.
Instruction Flow:

X2 → X1 → Decode → Execute
Resembles cognitive attention-perception-action cycle


Data Flow:

Register File ↔ ALU ↔ Memory
Models working memory-computation-storage interaction


Control Flow:

Instruction decode → Component control
Analogous to executive function control
