## ✨ Purpose

This framework is part of an interdisciplinary vision to combine **symbolic rigor**, **neural adaptability**, and **cognitive-aligned reasoning**. It reflects years of integrated work at the intersection of computer science, biopsychology, and meta-epistemology.

It is not just software. It is a **cognitive architecture**, and its use is **ethically bounded**.
